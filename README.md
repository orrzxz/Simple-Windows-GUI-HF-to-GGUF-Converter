A weekend project, made using DeepSeek.

QUICK SETUP:
1) Extract the files into a folder
2) Open Terminal, CD into the directory
3) Type "python setup.py"
4) Wait until setup is over. It's going to install and make llama.cpp in the root folder, where you put all your files at. It's also going to create a folder named "Converted", which is wwhere your converted models are gonna live.
5) Type "python app.py"
6) In the "Hugging Face Model Name" input field, type in the NAME (NOT URL) of the model you wish to download and convert. e,g. "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-Base"
7) Wait for it to do it's thing.
8) Profit!
